# TSE-ARF
(an multi-type secretion effector adaptive random forest)
First, new features are proposed for this constructive task. We newly pro-posed two features AAC-ZSCALE and ZAAC-PSSM to integrated with other three feature extraction techniques (AAC, PseAAC and AAC-PSSM) to convert the raw sequences into 290-dimensional feature vectors.
Second, the evaluation and comparison with current machine learning models and the existing state-of-the-art methods revealed the top perfor-mance in TSE-ARF, with the effectiveness of the adaptive ability in different secretion system datasets. 
Thirdly, we further applied TSE-ARF for genome-wide prediction and obtained recommended list of secreted effectors in multiple proteins across multiple bacterial species with high confidence. 
With these promising results, we believe that our predicted multiple secretory effectors can serve as initial screens for fol-low-up experiments. Therefore, the proposed TSE-ARF performs well in both accuracy and efficiency, and the robust generalization ability of TSE-ARF under different datasets and different settings is reflected in the experimental results.
